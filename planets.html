<button class="accordion">Mercury</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><center> <h2 style="color:#41aadb"> Mercury </h2> </center>
             
              <p style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: justify;"> <ul style="text-align:justify;">Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. It experiences temperatures of up to 427°C (801°F) during the day! However, because Mercury hardly has an atmosphere, it doesn't trap much heat so the temperature can drop down to -173°C (-297°F) at night. The weather's almost as unpredictable as Melbourne!</ul>
              
              <ul style="text-align:justify;">Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System. It has a diameter of only 4,878km (3,030 miles). That means Mercury is two-fifths the size of Earth and has a similar diameter to the United States of America. Mercury takes 88 days days to orbit the sun. Mercury also takes 58 days, 15 hours and 30 mins to complete a revolution. Mercury is 57,900,000km from the sun.</ul> 
                  </p></p>

<button class="accordion">Venus</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><center> <h2 style="color:#41aadb"> Venus </h2> </center>
             
              <p style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: justify;"> <ul style="text-align:justify;">Venus is the second closest planet to the sun. On average Venus experiences around 462°C (864°F). Even though Mercury is closer to the sun, Venus is hotter because it has a thick atmosphere that traps sunlight and heat into the planet. This phenomenom is called the greenhouse effect because the planet acts in the same way as a greenhouse.</ul>

              <ul style="text-align:justify;">Venus has a diameter of 12,104km which makes it the third smallest planet in our Solar System behind Mercury and Mars. That's 95% of the size of Earth. Venus takes 225 days to orbit the sun and has a roatation period of 117 days. That means you'll have your birthday every two days on Venus! Venus' distance from the sun is 108,200,000km.</ul>
                  </p></p>

<button class="accordion">Earth</button>
<div class="panel">
 <p><center> <h2 style="color:#41aadb"> Earth </h2> </center>
             
              <p style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: justify;"> <ul style="text-align:justify;">Earth is the third closest planet to the sun. Earth is the only known planet to hold life. Its temperature is perfect for life at an average of 16°C (61°F). Unfortunately this is changing due to natural and man-made global warming problems. Thi highest temperature recorded on Earth was 70.7°C (159.3°F) and the coldest temperature was -89.2°C (-129°F). The atmosphere is perfect for earth. It is thick enough to protect us from the sun's harsh waves of radiation but not too thick to trap too much heat in.</ul>
              
              <ul style="text-align:justify;">Earth's diameter is 12,756km which makes it the fifth largest planet. Earth takes 365 days to orbit the sun and each day lasts for 24 hours. The main reason Earth can support life is because it's distance from the sun is in the goldilocks zone. It's called the Goldilocks zone because It's not too hot and not too cold. It's just right! Its dstance from the sun is 149,600,000km form the sun.</ul> 
                  </p></p>

<button class="accordion">Mars</button>
<div class="panel">
 <p><center> <h2 style="color:#41aadb"> Mars</h2> </center>
              <p style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: justify;"> <ul style="text-align:justify;">Mars is the forth and final of the terrestrial planets. It is the forth closest to the sun. On average, Mars experiences an average temperature of -55°C (−67 °F) to 20°C (68 °F). It is believed that Mars could support life as there is evidence of potential water. Furthermore, sometime in the near future, NASA are sending a few volunteers on a one way ticket to Mars.</p>

              <ul style="text-align:justify;">Mars' diameter is 6,779km which makes it the second smallest planet. Mars takes 686 days to orbit the sun and each day on Mars lasts for 24 hours and 39 minutes. Mars is liveable because its days length is very similar to Earth's.</ul> 
                  </p></p>

<button class="accordion">Jupiter</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><center> <h2 style="color:#41aadb"> Jupiter </h2> </center>
              <p>Jupiter is the fifth closest planet to the sun. It is the largest planet in the Solar System at 142,800km in diameter. Jupiter is also the first of the gas planets. The average temperature of the clouds of Jupiter is -145°C (-234°F). Jupiter is known for its big, red 'eye' in the clouds of the planet. This 'eye' is a large red storm, double the size of Earth, that has been lasting for many, many years.</p>

              <ul style="text-align:justify;"> Jupiter takes 12 Earth years to orbit the sun. Each day on Jupiter lasts for an extemely short 10 hours. That's under half of a day on Earth!  
                  </p></div>

<button class="accordion">Saturn</button>
<div class="panel">
 <p><center> <h2 style="color:#41aadb">Saturn</h2> </center>
             
              <p style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: justify;"> <ul style="text-align:justify;">Saturn is the sixth closest planet to the sun. Saturn is iconic for its large ring surrounding the planet. This ring is made of ice and rock which is believed to be a part of a moon before it was crushed after crashing into another. Just like the planets to the sun, these rocks orbit Saturn.</ul>
              
              <ul style="text-align:justify;">Saturn's diameter is 120,660km which makes it the second largest planet behind Jupiter. Saturn takes 12 years on Earth to orbit The Sun however each day lasts for a mere 10 hours and 39 minutes.</ul> 
                  </p></p>
</div>


<button class="accordion">Uranus</button>
<div class="panel">
 <p><center> <h2 style="color:#41aadb">Uranus</h2> </center>
              <p>Uranus is a gas planet and is second from last away from the sun. It is the third largest planet in the Solar System, behind Jupiter and Saturn, with a diamter of 51,118km. Uranus is different from every other planet becuase its axis is horizontal and spins on its side.

              Uranus is exposed to an average temperature of -216°C (-357°F). Uranus has an orbit peroid of 84 Earth years and it takes 17 hours and 14 minutes to complete a full revolution.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Neptune</button>
<div class="panel">
 <p><center> <h2 style="color:#41aadb">Neptune</h2> </center>
              <p>Neptune is the final of the gas planets and the final planet in the Solar System. It is the forth largest planet in the Solar System at a diameter of 49,528km. Neptune has an average temperature of -214°C (-353°F).

              Neptune has an orbit period of 165 Earth Years and a day on Neptune takes 16 hours to complete </p>
