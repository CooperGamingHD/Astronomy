<h2> The Most Effective Formations </h2>
	

<li> In my opinion, any of the 4-3-3 formations work well in Fifa 17. Any of the 4-4-2, 3-4-3 and 4-3-2-1 will also work well. Feel free to experiment with any formations which may not be listed here or even create your own formations. Leave any suggestions for formations which you have found work for you. </li>



<h2> Gamemodes </h2>



<ul> Manager Career Mode: A gamemode that allows you to become a manager for any team of your choice and manage funds, transfers, wages, youth academy and much, much more </ul>
<ul> My Player Career Mode: A gamemode allowing you to create a player or choose form any player around the world. You can request loans or transfers and choose which club you shall start at in your career as a player. </ul>
<ul> Ultimate Team: Ultimate is a gamemode where you create a club, build your team, and verse other player's clubs online. Although Ultimate Team is mostly based online, you may do offline pack openings, drafts and offline games against the cpu.
<ul> The Journey: The Journey is a gamemode where you choose an EPL Club to start your career as 'Alex Hunter'. It has many cutscenes and is largely story based.
